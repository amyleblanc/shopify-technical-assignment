# Amy's OpenAI App for the Shopify Front End Fall 2022 Internship

Hello and welcome! I hope you enjoy my OpenAI project for the Frontend Developer Internship!

This is a 'prompt & response' generator app utilizing the OpenAI API [quickstart tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart) as a boilerplate. It uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Check out the tutorial to build your own project! 

To use my template, please follow the instructions below to get set up.

## Setup

1. Please use Node.js version 16 ($ nvm use 16). If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd shopify-frontend-internship
   ```

4. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

7. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! For the full context behind the original OpenAI example app, check out the [tutorial](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart).
